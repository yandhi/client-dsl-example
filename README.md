# Client DSL Examples

This is a pure proof of concept of using the client-dsl in an actual game. Ideally, I would like to show implementations
with other games besides minecraft, but for the time being, this repository is a kotlin-fabric implementation of the
client-dsl on minecraft 1.18.1.

## Events
<ul>
   <item>RenderInGameHud - The game's hud</item> <br>
   <item>KeyPress - GLFW keypress invoke so we can use macros</item>
</ul>

## Features

<ul>
Hud with feature list. <br>
Fullbright! (toggleable by B by default) <br>
Extensible macro system (infinite actions on each key)
</ul>
